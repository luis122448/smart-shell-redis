# redis.conf - Example for a cache

# --- MEMORY ---
# Set a memory limit. When reached, Redis will start evicting keys
# according to the 'maxmemory-policy'.
# This is crucial for a cache server to prevent it from using all available RAM.
# Example: 256 megabytes
# maxmemory 256mb

# Memory eviction policy. 'allkeys-lru' is an excellent choice for a cache,
# as it removes the least recently used keys.
# Other options: volatile-lru, allkeys-random, volatile-random, etc.
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# --- PERSISTENCE ---
# For a pure cache, it's often better to disable persistence to maximize
# performance, as you don't need the data to survive a restart.
# Comment out or remove the following 'save' lines to disable RDB.
# save 900 1
# save 300 10
# save 60 10000

# Disable AOF (Append Only File), another form of persistence.
appendonly no

# --- SECURITY ---
# It is good practice to protect your Redis instance with a password.
# Uncomment and change 'your-secure-password'.
# requirepass your-secure-password
